# Functionality
## Register
We register each ship with a dedicated button. It makes an etherium transaction, if the address is not used, the ship is placed on the grid.

## Turn
Each player has an input to indicate coordinates on the grid. When the player hits an etherium transaction is created. If there is a boat on the designated coordinate indicated by the player, the ship is hit and sinks, the boat diseapears from the grid and the game ends otherwise the game continues until a ship is destroyed.
